## The Problem

## Quick Fix Steps

### Step 1: Enable Google Sign-In in Firebase Console

2. Select your project: `guideian-b5eb4`
3. Go to **Authentication** â†’ **Sign-in method**
4. Find **Google** and click on it
5. **Enable** Google Sign-In
6. Set **Project support email** to `gguideian@gmail.com`
7. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Configure OAuth Consent Screen

2. Select project: `guideian-b5eb4`
3. Go to **APIs & Services** â†’ **OAuth consent screen**
4. Make sure it's configured as **External** (unless you have Google Workspace)
5. Add your email `gguideian@gmail.com` as a test user
6. Add these scopes:
   - `../auth/userinfo.email`
   - `../auth/userinfo.profile`
   - `openid`

### Step 3: Add Authorized Domains

2. Add these domains:
   - `localhost` (for development)
   - `guideian-b5eb4.firebaseapp.com`
   - Your production domain (when you deploy)

### Step 4: Test the Fix
1. Run your app: `flutter run -d edge`
2. Try Google Sign-In again
3. Check the browser console for any errors

## Common Issues

### Issue: "Error 400: redirect_uri_mismatch"
**Solution:** Make sure `localhost` is in your authorized domains

### Issue: "Error 403: access_denied"
**Solution:** Check OAuth consent screen configuration

### Issue: "Error 400: invalid_client"
**Solution:** Verify the client ID in `web/index.html` matches Firebase

- **Project ID:** `guideian-b5eb4`
- **Auth Domain:** `guideian-b5eb4.firebaseapp.com`

## Test After Each Step
After completing each step, test the Google Sign-In to see if the error changes. This will help identify which step fixed the issue.

## Still Not Working?
If it still doesn't work after these steps, check:
1. Browser console for specific error messages
2. Network tab for failed requests
3. Make sure you're testing in the same browser where you're logged into Google
